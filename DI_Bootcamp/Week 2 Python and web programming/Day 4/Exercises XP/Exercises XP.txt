Functions


Exercise 1  What Are You Learning 
Instructions
Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.


🌟 Exercise 2 What’s Your Favorite Book 
Instructions
Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called title.
The function should print a message, such as One of my favorite books is title.
For example “One of my favorite books is Alice in Wonderland”
Call the function, make sure to include a book title as an argument when calling the function.


🌟 Exercise 3  Some Geography
Instructions
Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.
The function should print a simple sentence, such as city is in country.
For example “Reykjavik is in Iceland”
Give the country parameter a default value.
Call your function.


Exercise 4  Random
Instructions
Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100.
Compare the two numbers, if it’s the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.


🌟 Exercise 5  Let’s Create Some Personalized Shirts !
Instructions
Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.
The function should print a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it, such as The size of the shirt is size and the text is text
Call the function make_shirt().

Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads “I love Python” by default.
Make a large shirt with the default message
Make medium shirt with the default message
Make a shirt of any size with a different message.

Bonus Call the function make_shirt() using keyword arguments.


🌟 Exercise 6  Magicians …
Instructions
Using this list of magician’s names

magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

Create a function called show_magicians(), which prints the name of each magician in the list.
Write a function called make_great() that modifies the list of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name.
Call the function make_great().
Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


🌟 Exercise 7  Temperature Advice
Instructions
Create a function called get_random_temp().
This function should return an integer between -10 and 40 degrees (Celsius), selected at random.
Test your function to make sure it generates expected results.

Create a function called main().
Inside this function, call get_random_temp() to get a temperature, and store its value in a variable.
Inform the user of the temperature in a friendly message, eg. “The temperature right now is 32 degrees Celsius.”

Let’s add more functionality to the main() function. Write some friendly advice relating to the temperature
below zero (eg. “Brrr, that’s freezing! Wear some extra layers today”)
between zero and 16 (eg. “Quite chilly! Don’t forget your coat”)
between 16 and 23
between 24 and 32
between 32 and 40

Change the get_random_temp() function
Add a parameter to the function, named ‘season’.
Inside the function, instead of simply generating a random number between -10 and 40, set lower and upper limits based on the season, eg. if season is ‘winter’, temperatures should only fall between -10 and 16.
Now that we’ve changed get_random_temp(), let’s change the main() function
Before calling get_random_temp(), we will need to decide on a season, so that we can call the function correctly. Ask the user to type in a season - ‘summer’, ‘autumn’ (you can use ‘fall’ if you prefer), ‘winter’, or ‘spring’.
Use the season as an argument when calling get_random_temp().

Bonus Give the temperature as a floating-point number instead of an integer.
Bonus Instead of asking for the season, ask the user for the number of the month (1 = January, 12 = December). Determine the season according to the month.


🌟 Exercise 5  Star Wars Quiz
Instructions
This project allows users to take a quiz to test their Star Wars knowledge.
The number of correctincorrect answers are tracked and the user receives different messages depending on how well they did on the quiz.

Here is an array of dictionaries, containing those questions and answers

data = [
    {
        question What is Baby Yoda's real name,
        answer Grogu
    },
    {
        question Where did Obi-Wan take Luke after his birth,
        answer Tatooine
    },
    {
        question What year did the first Star Wars movie come out,
        answer 1977
    },
    {
        question Who built C-3PO,
        answer Anakin Skywalker
    },
    {
        question Anakin Skywalker grew up to be who,
        answer Darth Vader
    },
    {
        question What species is Chewbacca,
        answer Wookiee
    }
]


Create a function that asks the questions to the user, and check his answers. Track the number of correct, incorrect answers. Create a list of wrong_answers
Create a function that informs the user of his number of correctincorrect answers.
Bonus  display to the user the questions he answered wrong, his answer, and the correct answer.
If he had more then 3 wrong answers, ask him to play again.
